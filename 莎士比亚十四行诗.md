# 莎士比亚十四行诗



## Sonnet 15

> When I consider everything that grows
>
> Holds in perfection but a little moment,
>
> That this huge stage presenteth naught but shows
>
> Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
>
> When I percieve that men as plants increase,
>
> Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky,
>
> Vault in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
>
> And wear their brace state out of memory;
>
> Then the conceit of this insonstant stay
>
> Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
>
> Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,
>
> To change your day of youth to sullied night;
>
> And, all in war with Time for love of you,
>
> As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

「当我看到，一切生长之物，只在刹那间能够完美。」

「世界舞台上一无所有，唯有星辰在秘密中牵引。」

「我看到人类像草木一样生长，被同样的天空赋予盛衰。」

「少时繁茂，日中则仄，一切美好都从记忆中被抹去。」

「于是这瞬间停留的诡计，让你青春的容颜出现在我面前。」

「而残暴的时间和腐朽商议，要把你青春的白日变成暗淡黑夜，」

「为了爱你，我将和时间对抗，」

「它从你身上夺走的，我会重新嫁接。」
